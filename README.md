# titanic-project
## Introduction:
This was my first project for my datascience course. In the first two weeks of the course, we learned basic python, pandas, numpy and matplotlib. Our goal was to implement these tools to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Titanic training dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). This was my first datascience/coding project ever.

## Data:
The dataset consists of information for 891 of the passengers on board the titanic for it tragic journey. Feautures inclue: title/name, gender, age, passenger class, fare price, cabin and point of embarkation. The label for the dataset was the survived column, which donotes whether a passenger survived the sinking or not.

## Objectives:
To perform EDA on the Titanic dataset using pandas, numpy and matplotlib.

## Findings:
I found that passengers in the second class had biggest gender survival gap, with over 90% of women and less than 20% of men surving. The differnece in survival rate between women and men in the second class was 76%. I also found that male passengers in the second class with no family on board had the lowest rate of survival of any group passengers that were traveling alone. Finally, the second class had the largest difference in survival between with families and those traveling alone, with 20% more of the former group surving.

## What I learned:
This project was my primary introduction to python, pandas and matplotlib. I used pandas to examine the data and to create subsections of groups of passengers. I used matplotlib to visualize my primary findings and learned a lot about plotting with matplotlib. This project provided a strong foundation for me to expand my pandas and matplotlib skills during future projects.
